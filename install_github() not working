Manually get the repo folder on your computer

Unzip to a folder not in ~/Documents/R/win-library/3.5
- this is reserved for installing packages into and would return an error on build and create worse complications

Open .Rprog file

Open description

Install Dependencies, Usually would need only imports

install.packages() takes in a vector so you could list them all out as strings and pass as arg

If they're not on CRAN, you'll have to run this process to install dependencies from github prior to final install

However, once thats done, Install and Restart

You could delete the folder that was previously unzipped because it's been cloned to the reserved folder from step 2


github.com/ropensci/git2r seems to provide some nice functionality as well but my specific issue was utils::download... not having access to the file
